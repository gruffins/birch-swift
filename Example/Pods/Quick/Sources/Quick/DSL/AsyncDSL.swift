     Defines a closure to that wraps each example in the current example

     The closure you pass to aroundEach receives a callback as its argument, which
     it MUST call exactly one for the example to run properly:

     aroundEach { runExample in
     doSomeSetup()
     runExample()
     doSomeCleanup()
     }

     This callback is particularly useful for test decartions that canâ€™t split
     into a separate beforeEach and afterEach. For example, running each example
     in its own autorelease pool (provided by Task) requires aroundEach:

     aroundEach { runExample in
     autoreleasepool {
     runExample()
     }
     checkObjectsNoLongerRetained()
     }

     You can also use aroundEach to guarantee proper nesting of setup and cleanup
     operations in situations where their relative order matters.

     An example group may contain an unlimited number of aroundEach callbacks.
     They will nest inside each other, with the first declared in the group
     nested at the outermost level.
